title: Research Topics

#   - Efficient optimization algorithms for deterministic or stochastic, large-scale constrained optimization, minimax problems, distributed optimization, bilevel optimization, and neural network training, including deep learning and large model training.
#   - Optimization and generalization for machine learning and AI, e.g., adversarial training, diffusion models, transformers.
#   - Learning methods for optimization.
#   - Data-driven optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, e.g., contextual optimization, robust optimization, offline reinforcement learning, and reward learning for sequential decision-making.
