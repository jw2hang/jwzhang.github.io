 - **Efficient optimization algorithms for deterministic or stochastic, large-scale constrained optimization, minimax problems, distributed optimization, bilevel optimization, and neural network training, including deep learning and large model training.**



 - **Optimization and generalization for machine learning and AI, e.g., adversarial training, diffusion models, transformers.**



 - **Learning methods for optimization.**



 - **Data-driven optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, e.g., contextual optimization, robust optimization, offline reinforcement learning, and reward learning for sequential decision-making, with applications to AI, energy, cyber-physical security and signal processing.**
