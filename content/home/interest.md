title: Research Topics
---
 1. Efficient optimization algorithms for deterministic or stochastic, large-scale constrained optimization, minimax problems, distributed optimization, bilevel optimization, and neural network training, including deep learning and large model training.
 
 2. Optimization and generalization for machine learning and AI, e.g., adversarial training, diffusion models, transformers.
 
 3. Learning methods for optimization.

 4. Data-driven optimization and decision-making under uncertainty, e.g., contextual optimization, robust optimization, offline reinforcement learning, and reward learning for sequential decision-making.
