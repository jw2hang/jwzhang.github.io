Jiawei Zhang is currently the postdoctoral scholar in the [Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems (LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu) at MIT, working with [Asuman Ozdaglar](https://asu.mit.edu).
He obtained the Ph.D. degree in Computer and Information Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), 
studied in [CUHK-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) with advisory of [Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dW3gcXoAAAAJ&hl=en).
Previously, he obtained the B.Sc. in Mathematics (Hua Loo-Keng talent program) University of Science and Technology of China.

His research interests include optimization theory, designing efficient optimization algorithms and their applications to
machine learning and data science. Recently, I am very interested in understanding machine learning especially deep
learning from an optimization perspective.

I organized two sessions in INFORMS Annual meeting 2022 on nonconvex nonsmooth optimization and nonconvex constrained optimization.
