Jiawei Zhang is currently the postdoctoral scholar in the Laboratory for Information & Decision Systems (LIDS) at MIT, working with Asuman Ozdaglar.
He obtained the Ph.D. degree in Computer and Information Engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), 
studied in CUHK-Shenzhen with advisory of Zhi-Quan (Tom) Luo.
Previously, he obtained the B.Sc. in Mathematics (Hua Loo-Keng talent program) University of Science and Technology of China.

His research interests include optimization theory, designing efficient optimization algorithms and their applications to
machine learning and data science. Recently, I am very interested in understanding machine learning especially deep
learning from an optimization perspective.
